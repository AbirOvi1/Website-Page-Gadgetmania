                            <h3>BEST MONITOR WITH BEST CONFIGURATION</h3>
                            <p>For students, our recommendations and minimum system requirements are meant to provide general guidelines on which computer configurations work best in the UMass Amherst computing environment. Different recommended and minimum configurations are available for faculty and staff. They focus on hardware specifications of the device. For free or discounted software please check our downloads page. If you have declared a major, we recommend checking with the department to see if it requires specific computer configurations. Note: This online document is where you will find the most accurate recommendations. Any print materials you have could be out-of-date.<br>
                                The best dual monitor for gaming we've tested is the ASUS VG279QM. It's an excellent gaming monitor with an extremely fast 240Hz refresh rate that you can overclock to 280Hz, and it has outstanding motion handling, resulting in crystal-clear motion with almost no noticeable blur behind fast-moving objects. It has outstanding ergonomics, thin bezels, and it can rotate to portrait orientation in either direction, so you can choose which way you want the inputs to face.

                                It has low input lag, ensuring a responsive gaming experience, and it supports both FreeSync and G-SYNC Compatible variable refresh rate technology, resulting in a near tear-free gaming experience if the frame rate of your game drops. It also has good connectivity with one DisplayPort input and two HDMI ports. However, it doesn't support daisy-chaining, so you'll need to ensure your source has multiple output ports or that your other monitor supports daisy-chaining if you want a multi-monitor setup.
                                
                                Unfortunately, it's not as well-suited for dark room gaming, as it has a low contrast ratio, so blacks look gray in a dark room. The 1080p native resolution is also a bit low, as it doesn't deliver a very immersive gaming experience. It's fine for fast-paced games, but it's not ideal for more scenic games. Regardless, it's an impressive monitor, and it's an outstanding choice for a dual monitor gaming setup.<br>
                                The best secondary monitor we've tested in the budget category is the ASUS ProArt Display PA278QV. It's a 27 inch model with a 1440p resolution and a 75Hz refresh rate. It means you get plenty of room for multitasking, text looks sharp, and the monitor feels more responsive than a typical 60Hz display. It has wide viewing angles that make it great for sharing content, and it gets bright enough to provide good visibility in well-lit settings.
